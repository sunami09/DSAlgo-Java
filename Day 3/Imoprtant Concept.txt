What is the output of following code?
    
    int i = 10;
    if(i++ == i)
 	 System.out.println(i + " is good");
    else
 	 System.out.println(i + " is bad");
 
    int j = 20;
    if(++j == j)
 	 System.out.println(j + " is good");
    else
 	 System.out.println(j + " is bad");

1. i returns the current value at memory location of i
2. ++i increments the value at memory location and returns new value
3. i++ increments the value at memory location and returns old value
4. lhs == rhs is evaluated left to right

Part1
The if condition in following code processes left to right
i++ changes the value of i to 11, but returns old value which is 10. This is compared by == to i (the current value at i's location, which is 11)
Hence the condition is false and we get 11 is bad.
int i = 10;
if(i++ == i)
System.out.println(i + " is good");
else
System.out.println(i + " is bad");

Part2
The if condition in following code processes left to right
++j changes the value of j to 21, and returns new value which is 21. This is compared by == to j (the current value at j's location, which is 21)
Hence the condition is true and we get 21 is bad.
int j = 20;
if(++j == j)
System.out.println(j + " is good");
else
System.out.println(j + " is bad");
